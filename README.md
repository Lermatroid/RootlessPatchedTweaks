# RootlessPatchedTweaks
A Github Repo W/ Pre-Patched Tweaks for Jakeashacks' Rootless JB

## How To Use/Install

All of these tweaks are pre-patched with Jake's Patcher. That makes this process quite a bit more simple for users. When Searching for a tweak just go to its folder, then go to its Library folder. Copy the MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibrairies files to /var/containers/Bundle/tweaksupport/Library/MobileSubstrate/DynamicLibrairies in Filza

lots of tweaks only have this folder, but some need a bit more work:

copy all prefrences to /var/containers/Bundle/tweaksupport/Library/PrefernceLoader/Preferences in Filza
copy the .bundel to /var/containers/Bundle/tweaksupport/Library/PrefernceBundles in Filza

As for installing Filza I Reccomend you follow Jakes Tutorial @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxmaZldVubc&t=36s

I have added A compiled filza ipa to this repo however it is untested
